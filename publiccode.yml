    shortDescription: The jEAP BusinessProcessTest Orchestrator is a component for orchestrating business process tests.
    longDescription: >
      The jEAP BusinessProcessTest Orchestrator is a component for orchestrating business process tests. In this context,
      business process tests are defined as tests that validate the behavior of a business process, ensuring that it
      meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. In such tests, the orchestrator is responsible for
      coordinating the execution of the test cases, managing the flow of the test scenarios, and ensuring that test 
      agents provide the necessary data and responses. The orchestrator also provides reporting capabilities,
      integrating with the Zephyr JIRA plugin for test case management.
    features:
      - Execution of business process tests by orchestrating test agents
      - Validaton of test results
      - Test report generation with integration of the Zepyhr JIRA plugin for test case management
